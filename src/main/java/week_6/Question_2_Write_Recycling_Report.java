/**
You work for a recycling company.
You’d like to collect some statistics on how much each of the houses on a certain street is recycling.

 Each house has to use crates for their recycling. Your program will count the number of crates set out by each house.

 This street is a little unusual since it only has 8 houses, and the city planner must have been a computer programmer,
 since the house numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

  (Hint – the house numbers are the same as array element indexes.)

 Write a program that asks for the number of recycling crates set out by each house.

 You should store, and process this data, in an array.

 DON'T use an ArrayList or LinkedList!

 Analyse your data and determine:
 * How many recycling crates, in total, from all the houses on the street?
 * What is the largest number of crates set out by any house?
 * What is the smallest number of crates set out by any house?
 * Which house had the most recycling? Display that house number.
 
 Finish the methods that do these calculations.
 Write your methods so that they work for any number of houses.
 
 Add code so that it writes the data as a report to a file.
 The report file should look like this example.
 Note that it should use "crate" for 1 crate, "crates" otherwise.
 
House 0 recycled 1 crate
House 1 recycled 2 crates
House 2 recycled 1 crate
House 3 recycled 2 crates
House 4 recycled 3 crates
House 5 recycled 3 crates
House 6 recycled 2 crates
House 7 recycled 1 crate
Total crates recycled: 15
 
 Add try-catch blocks for IOException in the writeReport method.  The try-with-resources version is recommended.
