/**
 
 This question uses the same code as Question 5 in Question_5_Add_Exception_Handling.java

 Instead of waiting for an exception and catching it, it is usually better to try and prevent problems.

 Can you think of better ways to stop this code crashing?
 
 Modify the printLanguageList and wordCount methods program so that both methods work correctly without using a try-catch statements.
