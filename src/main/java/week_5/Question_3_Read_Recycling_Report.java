 Look for a file called recyclingreport-mainstreet.txt in the Content > Labs tab of D2L.  Drag it into the root directory of your project. This file contains data for a much longer street. Can you read it into your program, process the data, and then display the numbers of the house(s) that recycled the most?


 If you havenâ€™t already, add try-catch blocks for IOException to Question 2 and Question 3's programs.  The try-with-resources version is recommended.
