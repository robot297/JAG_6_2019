 Question: Java doesn't make you deal with possible NullPointerException, or ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. These are called unchecked exceptions. So, why does Java insist that you deal with IOException â€“ a checked exception - in some way?   Java's checked vs. unchecked exceptions are unusual and questions on this subject are common in Java job interviews!


 Why is it usually better to anticipate and avoid errors when possible, instead of using try-catch blocks?
